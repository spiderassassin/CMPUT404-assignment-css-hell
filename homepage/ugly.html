        <h1>History</h1>  
        <p>I have had the opportunity to work for Professor Scott Smallwood as a Research Assistant, where I had to write C# scripts for a Unity Project. In addition, since September, I have been an Executive Producer for CMPUT 250, an interdisciplinary game development course offered at my university. The role of an Executive Producer is to oversee and provide mentorship to a team of 6 student game designers who are tasked with creating a small polished game in four months.</p>
